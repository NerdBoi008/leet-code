# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my **LeetCode problem-solving practice**, organized by difficulty level.  
I use this repo to build strong **DSA fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and maintain a consistent daily coding habit.

## Repository Structure

```tsx
.
├── easy/        # Easy level LeetCode problems
├── medium/      # Medium level LeetCode problems
├── hard/        # Hard level LeetCode problems
├── scripts/     # Utility scripts (helpers, runners, configs)
├── node_modules/
├── package.json

## Problem Organization

Each difficulty folder contains:

- Individual problem solutions
- Clean and readable code
- Focus on correctness first, optimization later

Example:

```tsx
easy/
├── two-sum.ts
├── valid-parentheses.ts
└── sqrt-x.ts

````

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language(s):** JavaScript / TypeScript  
- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Package Manager:** npm  

---

## How to Run Solutions Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd leet-code
````

2. Install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```

3. Run a solution (example):

```bash
node easy/two-sum.js
```

*(or via scripts if applicable)*

## Branch Strategy

- The **default branch represents the current focus difficulty**
- Example workflow:

  - `easy` → when solving Easy problems
  - `medium` → switched later
  - `hard` → switched later

This keeps progress clean while ensuring GitHub contributions are tracked.

## Goals

- ✔ Consistent daily practice
- ✔ Strong fundamentals in DSA
- ✔ Clean, readable solutions
- ✔ Gradual progression from Easy → Hard
